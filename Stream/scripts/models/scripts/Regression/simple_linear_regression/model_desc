                    Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more 
                    independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The model assumes 
                    a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y).
                    
                    Equation: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + ... + βₙxₙ
                    Where:
                    - y is the predicted value
                    - β₀ is the bias term
                    - β₁...βₙ are the weights for each feature
                    - x₁...xₙ are the input features
